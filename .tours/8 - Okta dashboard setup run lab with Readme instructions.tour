      "description": "After adding the necessary credentials:\n\n1. Enter the command `yarn bootstrap` in the terminal to seed the database with your test user. \n\n**Note**: The yarn bootstrap command will also run yarn resetdb to initialize your databases. During this process, you’ll see a prompt:\n\nAre you sure you want to reset your database? All data will be lost.\n\nType y and press Enter to reset and re-seed the databases.\nThis is required the first time you run the project, or whenever you want to start with clean test data.\n\n2. Next in the terminal enter the command `yarn build:agent0` to rebuild the project with your env credentials and finally enter the command `yarn start`.\n\n3. Open the following apps in incognito mode:\n\n- Todo app - http://localhost:3001\n- Agent0 - http://localhost:3000\n\n4. In the Todo app log in as user **bob@tables.fake** and add a few tasks in the app and check mark one of them as complete.\n\n5. Go back to the Agent0 app, select Model Claude 3.7 Sonnet and login in as user **bob@tables.fake** to test the following scenarios:\n\n- a. Add the prompt: `What's still on my plate?` (to get your list of tasks accomplished)\n\n**Note**: Here you are not prompted for consent for Agent0 to access your Todo0 app. This is the goal of XAA.\n\n- b. Still at your Agent0 app add a new todo using the following prompt: \n`Add a new todo: ‘add your test todo task here.’` (see a new task get added to the todo list)\n\n**Troubleshooting Tips**: \nIf you encounter any issue refer to the [README page](https://github.com/oktadev/okta-cross-app-access-mcp) of the main repo branch.",
