The MCP client must first request an ID-JAG token with an ID token from the Identity Provider (IdP), in this case, Okta. Then it will need to exchange the ID-JAG token for an access token from the Todo authorization server (AS) to retrieve the necessary tools from Todo MCP server.\n\nLet's start by reviewing the code to obtain an ID token.\n\n>**Note:** Ignore the errors you see under the problem tab for now, it will be fixed as you progress through the codetour lab.",
